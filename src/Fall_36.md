### Generated Report
# Police Investigation Report  

### 1. Case Categorization
> This case is classified as **"Cybercrime in the Narrow Sense"**,<br>
> as it directly involves an attack on the integrity and confidentiality<br>
> of IT systems through **ransomware**.<br>
> According to the Knowledge Graph, cybercrime in the narrow sense refers<br>
> to offenses where IT systems themselves are both the tool and target of the crime.<br>

### 2. Phenomenon Analysis
> The incident involves **ransomware**, a type of **malware specialized in extortion**.<br>
> The user downloaded an application from an unverified source,<br>
> leading to the **installation of malicious software**.<br>
> The ransomware encrypted or restricted access to the smartphone<br>
> and demanded a **€500 Bitcoin ransom** for unlocking the device.<br>
> Such attacks often exploit system vulnerabilities<br>
> (**e.g., drive-by downloads and browser vulnerabilities**),<br>
> making forensic analysis necessary.<br>

### 3. Legal Assessment
> The following German laws apply:<br>
> - **Extortion (§ 253 Abs. 1 StGB):** This offense covers cases where victims are<br>
>   pressured to make payments in exchange for regaining access to their property (IT system).<br>
> - **Computer Sabotage (§ 303B StGB):** This law criminalizes the disruption of IT processes,<br>
>   such as illegally preventing access to a personal device.<br>
> - Possible data theft implications should also be investigated.<br>

### 4. Investigation Strategy
> To gather evidence, the following forensic measures are recommended:<br>

1. **Determine IT System Details**<br>
   - Identify affected **device type** (smartphone model).<br>
   - Check **operating system version and update status**.<br>

2. **Investigate Malware Execution**<br>
   - Determine if **security programs (antivirus, firewall)** were active.<br>
   - Gather details on software involved, including **source of the application**.<br>

3. **Traces of Cybercriminals**<br>
   - Perform **domain analysis** on *free-gps-navigation.com* using **WHOIS lookup**<br>
     to uncover the domain’s admin and history.<br>
   - Conduct **IP address analysis** to check **associated ISP data** for further investigation.<br>
   - Examine **e-mail analysis** (if ransom demand was sent by email) to reveal the sender's details.<br>

4. **Digital Evidence Collection**<br>
   - Was the ransom message **photographed or recorded**?<br>
   - Identify **modifications in personal data** to detect any theft.<br>

> By systematically analyzing the attack vectors and conducting forensic investigations,<br>
> authorities can trace the source and mitigate further risks.<br>

### Ground Truth
# Police Investigation Report  
> **Date and Time:** 2024-05-10 20:30<br>
> **Location:** Online<br>
> **Incident Type:** Ransomware Attack<br>

#### 1. Case Categorization
> The case falls under **"Cybercrime in the narrow sense"**,<br>
> as it involves ransomware, which directly attacks IT systems<br>
> by encrypting data and demanding payment. This classification aligns<br>
> with the definition of cybercrime that involves offenses<br>
> committed through information technology,<br>
> specifically targeting the security, integrity, and confidentiality of digital systems.<br>

#### 2. Phenomenon Analysis
> The cybercrime technique involved is **ransomware**,<br>
> which functions by encrypting victim data or locking the affected device,<br>
> thereby preventing access until a ransom is paid.<br>
> The attack in this case was executed through downloading an app<br>
> from an unverified source, potentially via **drive-by-download**<br>
> or **malware specialized in extortion**, leading to data lockdown and ransom demand.<br>

#### 3. Legal Assessment
> - **Extortion (§ 253 Abs. 1 StGB):** The attacker unlawfully demanded a ransom<br>
>   by restricting device access.<br>
> - **Computer Sabotage (§ 303B StGB):** The ransomware attack disrupted IT processes<br>
>   by preventing device usage.<br>
> - **Data Protection Violation (§ 42 BDSG):** Suspicion of stolen personal data<br>
>   requires legal assessment regarding unauthorized data access.<br>

#### 4. Investigation Strategy
> Key forensic methods for this case:<br>
1. **E-Mail and Web Domain Analysis:**<br>
   - Conduct **Whois Query** on ‘free-gps-navigation.com’ to identify the domain owner.<br>
   - Perform **historical domain lookup** to check prior domain ownership and usage.<br>

2. **IP Address Analysis:**<br>
   - Utilize **IP address tracking** to trace request logs from the domain.<br>
   - Conduct a **Ripe NCC database search** to locate the responsible<br>
     Internet Service Provider (ISP).<br>

3. **Device Forensic Examination:**<br>
   - Assess **browser vulnerabilities** and encryption methods used.<br>
   - Verify installed malware through analysis of **spam email attachments**<br>
     or unauthorized downloads.<br>

4. **Victim Inquiry:**<br>
   - Was a screenshot of the ransom message taken?<br>
   - Was the smartphone’s firewall or antivirus active and updated?<br>
   - Through which provider was internet access obtained?<br>

> These measures ensure a structured investigation,<br>
> focusing on tracing cybercriminals and securing digital evidence.<br>
