### 4. Investigation Strategy
> To trace the perpetrators, the following forensic methods will be applied:<br>

1. **E-Mail Analysis**<br>
   - **Header Extraction:** Retrieve email metadata from the spoofed sender address (support@steuerkanzlei-frankfurt.com).<br>
   - **Header Evaluation:** Examine routing paths, **IP addresses**, and mail server details.<br>
   - **ISP Data Tracking:** Secure data from the Internet Service Provider (ISP) used by the attacker.<br>

2. **IP Address Analysis**<br>
   - Conduct **WHOIS queries** on **identified IP addresses** to identify the source’s internet provider.<br>
   - **Cross-reference** ISP databases and timestamps to track the sender’s origin.<br>

3. **Domain Analysis**<br>
   - Verify whether a **fraudulent website** was registered using **historical WHOIS lookup**.<br>
   - If applicable, identify the **web hosting provider** and **previous domain owners**.<br>

4. **Key Questions to Address**<br>
   - **Which websites were visited most recently?**<br>
   - **Which online banking procedure was used if data was stolen?**<br>
   - **Were system crash indications detected?**<br>

> By implementing these forensic approaches, we aim to reveal the identity of the phishing perpetrators and prevent further exploitation.<br>

### 4. Investigation Strategy
> The investigation will focus on **E-Mail Analysis**, **IP Address Analysis**, and **Domain Analysis**.<br>

#### E-Mail Analysis<br>
- **Extract the E-Mail Header** from the spoofed email.<br>
- **Analyze technical metadata**, including **IP addresses**, **Date and Time of sending**, and **Utilized servers**.<br>
- **Identify the E-Mail Sender’s true domain** and compare it against legitimate company records.<br>

#### IP Address Analysis<br>
